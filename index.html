        <h3>What is this?</h3>
        <p>Not sure yet. I know what I would like it to be, which is a source for documentation on all my more esoteric or opaque modules. You know, the ones where you either know it can do amazing things, but you can never remember how to get there. Or worst, the ones where you have a nagging feeling you are using approximately 13% of what the module can do. This is for those modules.</p>

        <h3>What can this be?</h3>
        <p>Well, that depends. The idea for this page/site/document/thing is to create a fairly simple and straight forward documentation framework that is easy to use and expand, but also very portable and useable on various devices and media, so that it more likely to be used. To that end, there is a focus on making the document simply, semantic and work well on computers, tablets, mobile devices and printed media. With this approach I am hoping to address two primary impediments in creating useful documentation for Eurorack modules, making is easy to create the documents and making the results <em>good</em>.</p>

        <h3>What's next?</h3>
        <p>Well, creating content, as the kids say these days. I've got a couple of modules on the docket, and once those are done, who knows. If what you see here seems interesting, useful, valuable, whatever, and you want to get into contact, hit me up at <a href="mailto:dave@moddoc.net">dave@moddoc.net</a>.</p>
