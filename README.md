# `modDoc`

Documentation for modules, because understanding how your modules work, and what they can do, is good.

## Why
Well, Eurorack and modular synthesis is super fun..... but, it's also very complex at times. Some of the most interesting, engaging and versatile modules available are also some of the most opaque with their interfaces. Not to say that these interfaces are intrinsically bad, many are very good, but learning them takes time, and with the number of individual modules/interfaces in front of you when you sit down at a typical modular synth, it can be overwhelming. `modDoc` is intended to help me, and maybe you, keep track of how my modules work and what they can do.

## What
This site is built and generated with **[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)**.

Eleventy is a easy to use, though quite flexible, Static Site Generator (SSG), which seemed like the right balance of accessible, simple and powerful. I work on complex IT and Web systems as my day job, I didn't want to do that on my off time, nor did I want to add part time operations and finance jobs to my work load, so an SSG seemed like the right solution. And the most important part was that I wanted the most effective tool that would get me to my end goal, a working documentation site, as quickly as possible, while still being able to manage and scale over time. It's hard to completely ignore my inner engineer ðŸ¤ª

## Contribution
I don't have many modules. In the grand scheme of the Eurorack ecosystem, no one really does. 

*Except Divkid... that guy has everything. Hey Ben* ðŸ˜‰

If `modDoc` is only the documentation that I come up with for my own modules, that's good enough for me. That said, it seems like this is something that would benefit a lot of Eurorack users, ***if*** there is enough documentation to make it worthwhile.

### That's where you come in ...
If you like the idea of having a single place for all the documentation you need on your modules, which can be printed, pulled up on your laptop, tablet, phone, whatever, help me help you... by helping me ðŸ˜‹

The approach to the documentation is pretty straight forward if you've ever done any web work. Take a look at the files, get sense for how they are laid out (which is very simply). If you want, pull the repo down and run it locally. Start putting together some pages for yourself. If you think you have something worthwhile for others, send me a PR and I'll take a look.

## Standards and expectations
I like semantic web standards. While that's becoming more and more unusual these days, the simplity, clarity and maintainability of semantically clear HTML, you know... the actual document, is still something I appreciate and strive for.

Thus... please understand that I will be only accepting contributions that follow the semantic standards and premise set forth in this code base. If you don't like that, you're more than welcome to fork the repo and build whatever you want, however you want. But if you are intending to submit something to be merged into the canonical repo and show up on modDoc.net, then please spend the time to look at the existing pages and follow the patterns.

CSS is your friend.... ðŸ™‚
