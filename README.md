# `modDoc`

Documentation for modules, because understanding how your modules work, and what they can do, is good.

## Why
Well, Eurorack and module synthesis is super fun..... but, it's also very complex at times. Some of the most interesting, engaging and versatile modules available are also some of the most opaque with their interfaces. Not to say that these interfaces are intrinsically bad, many are very good, but learning them takes time, and with the number of individual modules/interfaces in front of you when you sit down at a typical modular synth, it can be overwhelming. `modDoc` is intended to help me, and maybe you, keep track of how my modules work and what they can do.
